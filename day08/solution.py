    # We need to find all points that are collinear with at least two antennas
    # of the same frequency. The updated model states:
    # "an antinode occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least
    # two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance."
    #
    # This means:
    # 1) For each frequency, consider all pairs of antennas.
    # 2) Each pair of antennas defines a line. Every integer point in the grid 
    #    that lies on this line is an antinode for this frequency.
    #
    # To find points on the line defined by (y1, x1) and (y2, x2):
    # Let's form the line in standard form: A*x + B*y + C = 0
    # Given two points:
    #   A = y2 - y1
    #   B = x1 - x2
    #   C = x2*y1 - x1*y2
    # We do not need to worry about uniqueness because we will store all found points in a set.
    #
    # After generating all lines, we will check all points in the grid if they satisfy A*x + B*y + C = 0.
    # That would be O((R*C)*number_of_pairs), potentially large.
    #
    # But there's a potentially huge complexity problem if the grid is large.
    # Since the problem context is from a puzzle setting, let's assume the input is manageable.
    #
    # Optimization:
    # Instead of checking every grid cell against every line (which could be huge),
    # we can generate all points on the line by stepping from one antenna to the edges of the grid.
    #
    # Actually, we can do this:
    # A line passing through (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) can be represented by a direction vector (dy, dx) = (y2-y1, x2-x1).
    # Reduce (dy, dx) by their gcd to get the step: (sdy, sdx)
    # From one of the antennas, say (y1, x1), we move in both directions along (sdy, sdx) and (âˆ’sdy, -sdx)
    # until we go out of bounds. We add all points encountered.
    #
    # This way, we do not check the entire grid. We just walk along the line in both directions until we leave the grid.
    #
    # Steps:
    # For each frequency:
    #   For each pair of antennas:
    #       Compute sdy, sdx = direction vector reduced by gcd.
    #       From antenna A:
    #         Move forward in direction (sdy, sdx) until out of bounds. Add all points.
    #         Move backward in direction (-sdy, -sdx) until out of bounds. Add all points.
    #   All these points form antinodes for that frequency.
    # Then combine antinodes from all frequencies.
    #
    # This avoids O(R*C) checks and should be efficient enough.
